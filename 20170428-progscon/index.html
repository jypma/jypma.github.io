# Disruptive Development 

using Reactive Event-Sourced Systems in Scala and Java


Jan Ypma

jyp@tradeshift.com

---

# Agenda

- A bit of Tradeshift history
- Typical sources of failures
- Concurrency models
- Event sourcing
- Implementation
- Real-world use cases

---

# Tradeshift in 2011

.center[![Tradeshift system](tsold.svg)]

- Electronic network to connect business
- Two major software components
  - _the frontend_
  - _the backend_
- &lt;10 developers

---

# Tradeshift in 2017

.center[![Tradeshift system](tsnew.svg)]

- 30 deployed components (and growing)
- 250 developers
- 250.000 LoC in _just the backend_

---

# Scaling of Tradeshift's systems

- Moore's law applies to AWS 
- Single point of _not quite failing often enough_


- 2016 directive:

    _All new components must be clustered_

- Yeah, what about the 30-ish existing ones?
  - New architecture is needed

---

# Scaling of Tradehift's development process

- 2011: _"We're a Java shop"_
--

- 2017: Not really, at least not anymore
  - Groovy and grails
  - Scala 
  - Python, Go, Ruby
  - Crazy javascript people
- But still, mostly Java  
  
- Empower teams to pick their own language and frameworks
  - but interact through well-described standards and APIs (REST)

---

# Typical sources of failures

.center[![Tradeshift flow](tsflow.svg)]

- We're down!
  - We overloaded the database
  - which caused the backend to respond slowly
  - which caused the frontend to respond slowly
  - which caused our users' web browsers to respond slowly
  - which caused our users to reload their page
  - `GOTO 10`


--

- What, we're not that special?
  - _Let it crash_ [2003, Amstrong]
  - Micro-services [2005, Rodgers]
  - The Reactive Manifesto [2013, BonÃ©r, Farley, Kuhn, Thompson]
  - Self-contained systems [2015, [scs-architecture.org](http://scs-architecture.org)]

---

# Self-contained systems

.floatright[![Async comm](async.svg)]

- No outgoing calls while handling an incoming request
  - (except to our own databases)
  - All inter-service communication must be **asynchronous**
  - This implies data replication


- No single points of failure
  - System must be clustered
  
  
- Design must trivially scale to 10x expected load

---

# The actor model

.floatright[![Actors](actors.svg)]

- **Actor** is an entity that responds to messages by
  - sending _messages_ to any other actors
  - creating child actors
  - performing side-effects

- A parent actor is the **Supervisor** of its child actors. On child actor failure, parent decides what to do:
  - Restart child (and grandchildren)
  - Stop child (and grandchildren)
  - Escalate
  
- **Akka** is a toolkit for writing actors on the JVM
  - _Java_: Actor is a normal class that extends `UntypedActor` or `AbstractActor`
  - _Scala_: Actor is a normal class that implements the `Actor` trait
  - **Message** is an immutable, serializable, Java class (`case class`)

---

# Reactive streams

- Imagine an HTTP request with a very long response, that reads 1.000.000 rows from a DB

*Using Threads*
--

- Just block while reading (waits for more data), and block while writing (TCP send buffer full)

*Using Actors*
- Let's have a "Request Actor" and a "Database Actor" 
  1. Request Actor messages Database Actor to requests the rows
  2. Database Actor sends back 1.000.000 messages as fast as it can?
--

- Needs some sort of `Ack` protocol between Request Actor and Database Actor, or batching

*Using Reactive streams*
- What if we could combine the advantages of asynchronous messaging and add in backpressure?

# Concurrency model summary

- **Threads and locks**
.good[&rarr;] Most of us know this
.good[&rarr;] Obvious way to stream data
.bad[&rarr;]  Limited scalability (max threads) and performance (context switch)
.bad[&rarr;]  Deadlocks
.bad[&rarr;] Most of us _think_ we know this
- **Futures / Promises**
.good[&rarr;] Easy to grasp
.good[&rarr;] Solves thread scalability
.bad[&rarr;]  Still need locks for shared data access, or limit to single thread
.bad[&rarr;]  Can't stream data
- **Actors**
.good[&rarr;] Easier to reach both high scalability and performance
.good[&rarr;] Handle shared data without locks
.bad[&rarr;]  Learning curve
.bad[&rarr;]  Can't stream data
- **Reactive streams**
.good[&rarr;] Builds on actors for scalability and performance
.good[&rarr;] Easier to grasp than full-on actors
.good[&rarr;] Streaming

# Event sourcing

.center[![Event sourcing](eventsource.svg)]

- System considers an append-only **Event journal** the only source of truth
- **Aggregate** is one unit of information to which (and only which) an event atomically applies
- Events  have a guaranteed order, but only within an aggregate


---

# Event sourcing

- Nice scalability properties
  - Each aggregate can process changes independently
- All information that spans >1 aggregate is materialized asynchronously into secundary data stores

.center[![Event sourcing - events](eventsource-events.svg)]


- Traditionally only applied inside a system 
  - Synchronous APIs ("_get customer history_")
  
- Why not expose event stream itself?
  - Eventual consistency
  - Latency implications
  - Security implications

# Implementation

---

# Actor ping pong 

```
package akka;

trait Actor {
  def sender: ActorRef = ???            // this will return the sender of the current message "receive" is handling
  implicit def self: ActorRef = ???     // this is a reference to the current actor instance
  def context: ActorContext = ???       // interact with the actor system, create children, etc.
  
  def receive: PartialFunction[Any, Unit]    // handles received messages for this actor
}

trait ActorRef {
  def !(msg: Any)(implicit sender: ActorRef): Unit    // Sends a message to this actor
}
```

```
class PongActor extends Actor {
  override def receive = {
    case msg:String =>
      sender ! "pong"
  }
}
```

---

# Actor ping pong 

```
case object DoIt

class PingActor extends Actor {
  val pongActor: ActorRef = context.actorOf(Props[PongActor], "pongActor")
  var counter = 0

  override def receive = {
    case DoIt =>
      pongActor ! "ping"
    case msg:String =>
      counter += 1
      if (counter == 3) {
        context.system.shutdown()
      } else {
        sender ! "ping"
      }
  }
}
```

---

# Actor ping ping

```
object PingPong extends App {
    val system = ActorSystem()
    val pingActor = system.actorOf(Props[PingActor])
    pingActor ! DoIt
}
```

Output:
```
In PingActor - starting ping-pong
In PongActor - received message: ping
In PingActor - received message: pong
In PongActor - received message: ping
In PingActor - received message: pong
In PongActor - received message: ping
In PingActor - received message: pong
```

---

# Akka persistence

- Framework to do event sourcing using actors
- Persistence plugins for levelDB, cassandra, kafka, ...
- Each `PersistentActor` has a `String` identifier, under which events are stored

```
class ChatActor extends PersistentActor {
  override def persistenceId = "chat-1"
  
  var messages: Seq[String] = Seq.empty

  override def receiveCommand = {
    case "/list" => sender ! messages
    case msg: String => persist(msg) { evt =>
      messages :+= msg
      sender ! Done
    }
  }
  
  override def receiveRecover = {
    case msg: String => messages :+= msg
  }
}
```

---

# Akka remoting and clustering

- Transparently lets actors communicate between systems
- `ActorRef` can point to a remote actor
- Messages must be serializable (using configurable mechanisms)

```
    akka {
      actor {
        provider = "akka.remote.RemoteActorRefProvider"
      }
      remote {
        enabled-transports = ["akka.remote.netty.tcp"]
        netty.tcp {
          hostname = "127.0.0.1"
          port = 2552
        }
      }
      cluster {
        seed-nodes = [
          "akka.tcp://ClusterSystem@127.0.0.1:2551",
          "akka.tcp://ClusterSystem@127.0.0.1:2552"]
      }
    }
```

---

# Akka cluster sharding

- Dynamically distributes a group of actors across an akka cluster
- Cluster sharding needs to know where a particular message should go

```
case class ChatMessage(chatId: UUID, msg: String)

val extractEntityId: ShardRegion.ExtractEntityId = {
  case msg:ChatMessage => (msg.chatId.toString, msg)
}

val extractShardId: ShardRegion.ExtractShardId = {
  case msg:ChatMessage => (msg.chatId.getLeastSignificantBits % 100).toString
}
```

---

# Akka cluster sharding

- `ShardRegion` proxy sits between client and real (remote) persistent actor
- Persistent actor names will be their persistence id

```
class ChatActor extends PersistentActor {
  // ...
  override def persistenceId = self.path.name
}

val proxy: ActorRef = ClusterSharding(system).start(
            "conversations",
            Props[ChatActor],
            ClusterShardingSettings(system), 
            extractEntityId, extractShardId)

proxy ! ChatMessage(UUID.fromString("67c67d28-4719-4bf9-bfe6-3944ed961a60"), "hello!"))
```

---

# Akka streams

.center[![Streams - terms](stream-terms.svg)]

- `Graph` is a *blueprint* for a closed, finite network of *stages*, which communicate by streaming elements
- `GraphStage[S extends Shape]` is one processing stage within a graph, taking elements in through zero or more *Inlets*, and emitting through *Outlets*
- It's completely up to the stage when and how to respond to arriving elements
- All built-in graph stages embrace _backpressure_ and _bounded processing_

#### Mostly used graph stages
- `Source[T, M]` has one outlet of type `T`
- `Sink[T, M]` has one inlet of type `T` 
- `Flow[A, B, M]` has one inlet of type `A` and one outlet of type `B`
- `RunnableGraph[M]` has no inlets or outlets

---

# Hello, streams

```
val system = ActorSystem()
val materializer = ActorMaterializer(system)

val numbers: Source[Int, NotUsed] = Source.range(1, 100)
val format: Flow[Int, String, NotUsed] = Flow[Int].map(i => i.toString)
val print: Sink[String, Future[Done]] = Sink.foreach(i => System.out.println(i))

val done: Future[Done] = numbers.via(format).to(print).run(materializer)

// Output: 
// 1
// 2
// ...
```

---

# Event journal over HTTP

- We wanted easy consumption of the event log by other systems
- HTTP chunked encoding (1 chunk per event), without completion

```php
GET /events?since=1473689920000 HTTP/1.1

200 OK
Content-Type: application/protobuf
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

14
(14 bytes with the first protobuf event)
11
(11 bytes with the second protobuf event)
(TCP stream stalls here)
```

- Additional events can arrive in real time

- Ideal to use with akka streams

---

# Putting it all together

- 2015: Let's try it out first
- 2016: _Collaboration_ in production
  - Real-time text message exchange between employees
  - Text interface to automated travel agent
  
- 2017: Migrating _Network_
  - Global Tradeshift network graph

- Stuff that works well for us: [https://github.com/Tradeshift/ts-reaktive/](https://github.com/Tradeshift/ts-reaktive/)
  - `ts-reaktive-actors`: Persistent actor Java base classes with reasonable defaults, and HTTP API for event journal
  - `ts-reaktive-marshal`: Non-blocking streaming marshalling framework for akka streams
  - `ts-reaktive-replication`: Master-slave replication across data centers for persistent actors

---

# Use case: collaboration

.center[![Collaboration architecture](collaboration.svg)]

- _Content_ backend has API to add messages to conversations
  - Messages go into the event journal
  - Journal is queryable over HTTP
- _Presentation_ backend listens to event stream
  - Materializes into views that are UI dependent
  - Can combine other sources as well
- Browser talks to both Presentation and Content backends
- Web socket stream informs browser of incoming messages

---

# Use case: Business network routing

- Legacy backend system
  - &nbsp;&gt;500.000 company accounts with business identifiers
  - Currently in a relational database
  - Updated in-place
- Migration strategy
  1. Introduce event journal alongside existing data
  2. Write event sourced new identity microservice
  3. Start continuous import of events from the old system
  4. Swap over

.center[![Identity](identity.svg)]

---

# Wrap-up

- Scalable systems: check
- Scalable development: check

- We're not quite there yet
  - Akka, cassandra and the reaktive combo in active development
  - Attitude of _I've done Spring for 10+ years successfully, why would I learn this_
  - The proof is in more pudding

# Data binding: a solved problem?

- Who remembers this?

```
@XmlRootElement
class Person {
    private final String firstName, lastName;
    private final List<String> address;
    
    public Person (String firstName, String lastName, Iterable<String> address) {
        this.firstName = firstName;
        this.lastName = lastName;
        this.address = Collections.unmodifiableList(new ArrayList(address)); 
    }
    
    public String getFirstName() { return firstName; }
    public String getLastName() { return lastName; }
    public List<String> getAddress() { return address; }
}
``` 

---

# Data binding: a solved problem?

- Who remembers this?

```
*@XmlRootElement(namespace = Constants.API, name = "Person")
*@XmlAccessorType(XmlAccessType.NONE)
class Person {
    private final String firstName, lastName;
    private final List<String> address;
    
    public Person (String firstName, String lastName, Iterable<String> address) {
        this.firstName = firstName;
        this.lastName = lastName;
        this.address = Collections.unmodifiableList(new ArrayList(address)); 
    }
    
*    @XmlAttribute("firstName")
    public String getFirstName() { return firstName; }
    
*    @XmlAttribute("lastName")
    public String getLastName() { return lastName; }
    
*    @XmlElement(namespace = Constants.API, "Address")
    public List<String> getAddress() { return address; }
}
``` 

---

# Data binding: a solved problem?

- Scala people have it a bit nicer

```
@XmlRootElement(namespace = API, name = "Person")
@XmlAccessorType(XmlAccessType.FIELD)
case class Person(firstName: String, lastName: String, address: Seq[String])
```
- or do they? .small[ ([scalaxb](http://scalaxb.org/) solves some of this for XML) ]

- Other challenges
  - JSON and XML on one API, both should look nice
  - Huge requests
  - Maintainability (reflection, AOP, ...)
  - Discoverability (what annotations to attach where)
  - Type and data represenation are linked
  - Express request-only or response-only classes

---

# Data binding through code

```
WriteProtocol<XMLEvent,Person> proto = 
  tag(qname(API, "person"),
    Person::getFirstName, attribute(qname("firstName")),
    Person::getLastName, attribute(qname("lastName")),
    Person::getAddress, iterable(
      tag(qname(API, "Address"), 
        body
      )
    )
  );
```
- Put the first name into `attribute` `firstName`, the last into `lastName`, and the address into the `body` of nested `Address` tags.
  - which can then be used e.g. with STaX:

    `String xml = stax.writeAsString(person, proto.writer());`
    
  - or with akka:

    `Flow<XMLEvent,Person> f = ProtocolReader.of(proto);`

---
# Getting creative

- Extract and write _any_ tag and have it represented as a string
    
```
Protocol<XMLEvent,QName> p = XMLProtocol.anyTag
```
    
- Extract and write any tag in the default namespace and its body into a `Tuple2` ([javaslang.io](http://www.javaslang.io))

```
Protocol<XMLEvent,Tuple2<String,String>> p = XMLProtocol.anyTag.asLocalName()
```

- Represent the `<props><key1>value1</key1><key2>more</key2></props>` pattern as a normal `Map`

```
Protocol<XMLEvent,Map<String, String>> proto = tag(qname("props"),
  hashMap(
    anyTagWithBody.asLocalName()
  ));
```

- `Map<String,String>` of _all nested tag names and their 'value' attribute_
- `Map<String,String>` of _all of this tag's attributes_ 

---
# Reactive marshalling

- Fully streaming
- No reflection / AOP / annotations / ...
- DSLs for XML, JSON and CSV, but a unified base API
- Variants for Java and (coming up) Scala
- To be added to akka's [alpakka](https://github.com/akka/alpakka) integration repository
- For now, check [ts-reaktive-marshal](https://github.com/Tradeshift/ts-reaktive/tree/master/ts-reaktive-marshal) on Github
